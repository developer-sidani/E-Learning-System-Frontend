    question: 'How Do Online Programs Work?',
    answer:
      "Some programs are a combination of on-campus and online study, while other programs are offered totally online. Often students are allowed to create their own study schedules using class materials, such as taped lectures and slide show presentations, which are accessible 24-7 through an Internet-based portal. Through this platform, students can also find their assignments, upload homework, participate in class discussions and contact their instructors.In some instances, students may be required to log into class at the same time to attend events, such as live webcasts or online chat sessions. In addition, students usually have access to the school library's online databases, where they can view study materials, such as the online editions of academic journals and periodicals. Students in distance-learning programs may be required to complete exams under the supervision of a proctor. Communication between students and instructors can occur through a variety of media, including: -Video chats -Web conferencing -Instant messaging -Message boards -Discussion forums",

Sometimes, these experiences can be set up in approved locations in the student's area.

    question: 'How do I choose a program?',
    answer:
      "One of the major concerns surrounding the choice of an online education program is determining if the program offers a legitimate degree or college credits that are accepted by other schools, employers and institutions that provide student aid funding. Schools recognized by a national or regional accreditation agency offer programs that meet the same standards as a school's on-campus offerings. Most schools list their accreditation on their website, and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation maintains an accreditation directory. Also, the U.S. Department of Education has a database of accredited secondary and post secondary schools, as well as a list of accreditation agencies.",
